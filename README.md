# About Me
Hi All ! I am Ishan, a committed coder who can also play a guitar! I love to code and have interestes in Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
  
Here you will find a multitude of projects, ranging from the implementation of boosting models to implementing deep learning architectures from scratch.

I am active on a number of Hackathon platforms and have secured Global Ranks in Top 25 a couple of times as well :-)
